### Only a Front-End, the idea is

for TopoRemedialAction, Modelimprovements or planned outages by OPC:

- Generate Testdata
- Backoffice Preparation
- Data Exchange via randomized (hashed) Timeseries exported as DifferenceModels (Delta-Schedule)
- Future: Load all kinds of Timeseries / Schedules
- Implementation in python, some other options might follow.
- Shoud be locally deployable in different sandboxed environtments or just as a kiosk stream keeping track of changes made by different internal processes.
  
Import/Export Option will follow as CIMXML, .csv or DiffModel
